        In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic in mid-2020, the team found themselves compelled to
        procure a commercial license for TeamViewer to facilitate remote work. However, they were taken
        aback by the exorbitant cost. Following a restless night, they embarked on a mission to create an alternative
        solution. Thus, RustDesk was conceived â€” an open-source, freely accessible remote desktop software that was
        diligently crafted through numerous sleepless nights. This labor of dedication and determination culminated in
        the release of RustDesk on GitHub in 2021, allowing it to be utilized by individuals worldwide.
