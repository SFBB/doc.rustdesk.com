## Hardware requirement

Lowest level VPS is enough for your use cases. The server software is not CPU and memory intensive. Our public ID server hosted on a 2 CPU/4 GB Vultr server serves 1.0+ million endpoints. Each relay connection consumes avg 180kb per second. 1 cpu core and 1G ram is enough to support 1000 relay concurrent connections.

## License

You can get license from https://rustdesk.com/pricing.html, check [license](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-pro/license/) page for more details.

## Get started
### 1, Installation

```
bash <(wget -qO- https://get.docker.com)
wget rustdesk.com/pro.yml -O compose.yml
sudo docker compose up -d
```

For more details, please check [Docker](/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-pro/installscript/docker/).

### 2, Ports Required

You need port `21114`-`21119` TCP and `21116` UDP open, please ensure these ports are setup when you set firewall rules and Docker port mapping.

More information about these ports, please check [here](/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-oss/install/#ports).

### 3, Set license

Open your web console by accessing `http://<server ip>:21114`, [log in](/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-pro/console/#log-in) using the default credentials admin/test1234 `admin`/`test1234`. Follow [this guide](/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-pro/license/#set-license) to set the license.

### 4, Setup HTTPS for web console

> You can skip this step if you don't want to use HTTPS during the trial, but remember to change the client's API address after you set up HTTPS

Here is a simple tutorial of [manual HTTPS setup](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-pro/faq/#set-up-https-for-web-console-manually).

### 5, Configure client to use the self-hosted server

https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/client-configuration/

### 6, Set up WebSocket

To enable web client or [desktop / mobile client](/docs/en/self-host/client-configuration/advanced-settings/#allow-websocket) work properly with WebSocket, you need to add the following settings to your reverse proxy configuration.
