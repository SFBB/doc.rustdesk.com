## Enable permissions

{{% notice note %}}
Due to macOS security policy change, our api which captures input on local side does not work any
more. You have to enable "Input Monitoring" permission on local Mac side.
Please follow this
[https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/issues/974#issuecomment-1185644923](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/issues/974#issuecomment-1185644923).

In version 1.2.4, you can try out `Input source 2` which can be seen by clicking on keyboard icon on the toolbar.

To capture screen, you need to grant RustDesk **Accessibility** permission and **Screen Recording** permission. RustDesk will guide you to the settings window.

| RustDesk window | Settings window |

If you have enabled it in the settings window, but RustDesk still warns. Please remove `RustDesk` from the settings windows by the `-` button, and click on `+` button, select `RustDesk` in `Applications`.
